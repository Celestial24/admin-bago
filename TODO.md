# TODO: Make Sidebar Mobile Responsive in Facilities Reservation.php

## Tasks
- [ ] Add mobile menu button (hamburger icon) in the top header area
- [ ] Add mobile menu overlay div
- [ ] Update CSS to include mobile responsiveness (position sidebar off-screen, add transitions, overlay behavior)
- [ ] Add JavaScript to handle sidebar toggle functionality
- [ ] Test the mobile responsiveness

## Information Gathered
- Current sidebar is fixed width 280px, always visible
- Main content has margin-left: 280px
- Need to add mobile-specific behavior similar to sidebar.php
- Mobile breakpoint: max-width 768px
- Sidebar should slide from left, overlay appears when open

## Plan
1. Insert mobile menu button in the top header (visible only on mobile)
2. Add overlay div after the container
3. Update the CSS styles to include mobile media queries for sidebar positioning and overlay
4. Add JavaScript event listeners for toggle button and overlay click
5. Ensure sidebar closes when overlay is clicked

## Dependent Files
- Facilities Reservation.php (only file being modified)

## Followup Steps
- Test on different screen sizes
- Verify hamburger icon appears/disappears correctly
- Check sidebar slides in/out smoothly
- Confirm overlay blocks interaction when sidebar is open
